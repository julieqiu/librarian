## Quickstart

This quickstart shows you how to install the package and make your first
Gemini API request.

### Before you begin

You need a Gemini API key. If you don't already have one, you can get it for
free in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys)
([step-by-step instructions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)).

### Installing the package into your application

> [!TIP]
> You can create a skeleton application by running the terminal command: `dart create myapp`

Run the terminal command:

```sh
dart pub add google_cloud_ai_generativelanguage_v1beta
```

### Make your first request

Here is an example that uses the generateContent method to send a request to
the Gemini API using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model.

If you set your API key as the environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY` or
`GOOGLE_API_KEY`, the API key will be picked up automatically by the client
when using the Gemini API libraries. Otherwise you will need to pass your
API key as an argument when initializing the client.
