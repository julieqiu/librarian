	//
	// API is used by generate and configure commands.
	//
	// API Path is specified with the -api flag.
	API string

	// APISource is the path to the root of the googleapis repository.
	// When this is not specified, the googleapis repository is cloned
	// automatically.
	//
	// APISource is used by generate, update-apis and configure
	// commands.
	//
	// APISource is specified with the -api-source flag.
	APISource string

	// Branch is the remote branch of the language repository to use.
	// This is the branch which is cloned when Repo is a URL, and also used
	// as the base reference for any pull requests created by the command.
	// By default, the branch "main" is used.
	Branch string

	// Build determines whether to build the generated library, and is only
	// used in the generate command.
	//
	// Build is specified with the -build flag.
	Build bool

	// CI is the type of Continuous Integration (CI) environment in which

	CI string

	// CommandName is the name of the command being executed.
	//
	// commandName is populated automatically after flag parsing. No user setup is
	// expected.
	CommandName string

	// Commit determines whether to creat a commit for the release but not create
	// a pull request.
	//
	// This flag is ignored if Push is set to true.
	Commit bool

	// GitHubToken is the access token to use for all operations involving
	// GitHub.
	//
	// GitHubToken is used by to configure, update-apis and update-image-tag commands,
	// when Push is true.
	//
	// GitHubToken is not specified by a flag, as flags are logged and the
	// access token is sensitive information. Instead, it is fetched from the
	// LIBRARIAN_GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.
	GitHubToken string

	// HostMount is used to remap Docker mount paths when running in environments
	// where Docker containers are siblings (e.g., Kokoro).
	// It specifies a mount point from the Docker host into the Docker container.
	// The format is "{host-dir}:{local-dir}".
	//
	// HostMount is specified with the -host-mount flag.
	HostMount string

	// Image is the language-specific container image to use for language-specific
	// operations. It is primarily used for testing Librarian and/or new images.
	//
	// Image is used by all commands which perform language-specific operations.
	// If this is set via the -image flag, it is expected to be used directly
	// (potentially including a repository and/or tag). If the -image flag is not
	// set, use an image configured in the `config.yaml`.
	//
	// Image is specified with the -image flag.
	Image string

	// Library is the library ID to generate (e.g. google-cloud-secretmanager-v1 ).
	// This usually corresponds to a releasable language unit -- for Go this would
	// be a Go module or for dotnet the name of a NuGet package. If neither this nor
	// api is specified all currently managed libraries will be regenerated.
	Library string

	// LibraryVersion is the library version to release.
	//
	// Overrides the automatic semantic version calculation and forces a specific
	// version for a library.
	// This is intended for exceptional cases, such as applying a backport patch
	// or forcing a major version bump.
	//
	// Requires the --library flag to be specified.
	LibraryVersion string

	// PullRequest to target and operate one in the context of a release.
	//
	// The pull request should be in the format `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}`.
	// Setting this field for `tag-and-release` means librarian will only attempt
	// to process this exact pull request and not search for other pull requests
	// that may be ready for tagging and releasing.
	PullRequest string

	// Push determines whether to push changes to GitHub. It is used in
	// all commands that create commits in a language repository:
	// configure and update-apis.
	// These commands all create pull requests if they
	//
	// By default (when Push isn't explicitly specified), commits are created in
	// the language repo (whether a fresh clone or one specified with RepoRoot)
	// but no pull request is created. In this situation, the description of the
	// pull request that would have been created is displayed in the output of
	// the command.
	//
	// When Push is true, GitHubToken must also be specified.
	//
	// Push is specified with the -push flag. No value is required.
	Push bool

	// Repo specifies the language repository to use, as either a local root directory
	// or a URL to clone from. If a local directory is specified, it can
	// be relative to the current working directory. The repository must
	// be in a clean state (i.e. git status should report no changes) to avoid mixing
	// Librarian-created changes with other changes.
	//
	// Repo is used by all commands which operate on a language repository:
	// configure, generate, update-apis.
	//
	// When a local directory is specified for the generate command, the repo is checked to
	// determine whether the specified API path is configured as a library. See the generate
	// command documentation for more details.
	// For all commands other than generate, omitting Repo is equivalent to
	// specifying Repo as https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-{Language}.
	//
	// Repo is specified with the -repo flag.
	Repo string

	// UserGID is the group ID of the current user. It is used to run Docker
