regeneration, and release. It runs language-agnostic workflows while
delegating language-specific tasks—such as code generation, building, and
testing—to Docker images.

The commands are:

# publish-release

The publish-release command runs a Cloud Build job to create a tag on a merged release pull
request.

Usage:

	automation publish-release [flags]

Flags:

	-project string
	  	Google Cloud Platform project ID (default "cloud-sdk-librarian-prod")
