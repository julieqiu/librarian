# Central Catalog of APIs
# This file serves as the master list of all APIs available for client library generation.
# It maps logical API groups to their specific proto and service configuration paths within
# the googleapis/googleapis repository.

# APIs that SHOULD be onboarded by language repositories.
# These represent the active, supported surface of Google Cloud APIs.
