# Example Service Configuration
# This file represents the structure of a service_config.yaml (formerly .proto.yaml)
# found in the googleapis/googleapis repository. It defines how the API is exposed
# and provides hints for client library generation.

# The 'publishing' section is deprecated and its responsibilities are now handled
# by the Librarian tool (librarian.yaml and catalog.yaml) for release metadata,
# issue tracking, and documentation links.
