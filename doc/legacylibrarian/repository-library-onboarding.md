# Repository/Library Onboarding Guide

This guide should be followed when onboarding new repositories/libraries.

## Repository Setup:
1) [Create a ticket](http://go/onboard-repository-to-librarian) to onboard a repository to Librarian automation (automation is per repository not library). At a minimum, you should onboard to [tag-and-release](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/googleapis/librarian/cmd/librarian#hdr-release_tag_and_release) automation. 
2) Add `.librarian` directory to your repository with appropriate configuration files. See details [here](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/doc/language-onboarding.md#configure-repository-to-work-with-librarian-cli)
3) You should only start with 1 library to validate the flow (follow instructions below)
4) If your repository contains multiple libraries, start ramping up slowly until all libraries are in your `state.yaml` file and have migrated to librarian.
5) To complete onboarding you should run the librarian test-container generate command to validate that all libraries are getting generated correctly. Note this standalone command is WIP, currently you can run [update-image](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/googleapis/librarian/cmd/librarian#hdr-update_image) command with `-test` flag to trigger tests after generation.  
6) To correctly parse the commit message of a merge commit, only allow squash merging
and set the default commit message to **Pull request title and description**.

## Library Setup:

### If you currently are using owlbot/release-please for generation and release:
1) Ensure all OwlBot PRs for that library have been merged and then release the library using a release-please PR
2) Remove the library from your OwlBot config
    - If you have an .Owlbot.yaml config file with multiple libraries, remove the library from .Owlbot.yaml file.
    - If your .Owlbot.yaml config file contains only the single library, remove the .Owlbot.yaml file itself.
3) Remove the library from your release-please config
    - For a monolithic repo remove the path entry for the library in your release-please-config.json and .release-please-manifest.json files
    - For a single library repository, remove all the release-please config (.github/release-please.yml, release-please-config.json if it exists, .release-please-manifest.json if it exists)
4) There is no requirement to stop using library-specific post-processing files as part of this migration. However, any post processing should be included in a file named "librarian.<ext>", where <ext> corresponds to the script's file extension (e.g., "sh", "py"). While migrating, please also consider opening an issue in your generator repository for any improvements that could reduce your library's post-processing logic.

### General Library Setup Steps
1) Add your library to your [libraries object](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/doc/state-schema.md#libraries-object) in your [state.yaml](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/doc/state-schema.md#stateyaml-schema) file.
2) Run [librarian generate command](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/googleapis/librarian/cmd/librarian#hdr-generate).  The output should be 0 diff, check with your language lead/generator owner if this is not the case.
3) Be aware of the `generate_blocked` and `release_blocked` fields in the [config.yaml file](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/doc/config-schema.md#libraries-object). If these are not set and automation is enabled for the repository ([check here](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/internal/legacylibrarian/legacyautomation/prod/repositories.yaml)), then generate and release PRs will be created and merged automatically. If these actions are blocked, or your repository is not set up for automation, you will have to perform these actions manually. See this [guide](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/doc/library-maintainer-guide.md) for details.
