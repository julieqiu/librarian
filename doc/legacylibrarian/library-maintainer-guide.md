# Library Maintainer Guide

This guide is task-oriented, specifically for core/handwritten/hybrid library
maintainers. See the
[generated CLI documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/googleapis/librarian/cmd/legacylibrarian)
for a more comprehensive list of commands and flags.

For libraries onboarded to automation, please see [automation section below](#using-automated-releases).

This guide uses the term Librarian (capital L, regular font) for the overall
Librarian system, and `legacylibrarian` (lower case L, code font) for the CLI.

## Internal support (Googlers)

If anything in this guide is unclear, please see go/g3doc-cloud-sdk-librarian-support

## Configuring development environment

See [Setup Environment to Run Librarian](onboarding.md#step-1-setup-environment-to-run-librarian).

## Running `legacylibrarian`

See [Running Librarian](onboarding.md#step-6-running-librarian).

## Initiating a release

The release process consists of four steps (at a high level; there are more
details which aren't relevant to this guide):

1. Creating a release PR using `legacylibrarian`
2. Reviewing/merging the release PR
3. Creating a tag for the commit created by the merged release PR
4. Running a release job (to build, test, publish) on the tagged commit

Step 1 is described in this section.

Step 2 is simply the normal process of reviewing and merging a PR.

Steps 3 and 4 are automated; step 3 should occur within about 5 minutes of the
release PR being merged, and this will trigger step 4. The instructions for the
remainder of this section are about step 1.

### Hands-off release PR creation

If you are reasonably confident that the release notes won't need editing, the
simplest way to initiate a release is to ask `legacylibrarian` to create the release
PR for you:

```sh
$ LIBRARIAN_GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) legacylibrarian release stage -push \
  -repo=https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go -library=bigtable
```

This will use the conventional commits since the last release to populate
any release notes in both the PR and the relevant changelog file in the repo.

If you want to release a version other than the one inferred by the conventional
commits (e.g. for a prerelease or a patch), you can use the `-library-version`
flag:

```sh
$ LIBRARIAN_GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) legacylibrarian release stage -push \
  -repo=https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go -library=bigtable \
  -library-version=1.2.3
```

Note that if `librarian` doesn't detect any conventional commits that would
trigger a release, you *must* specify the `-library-version` flag.

### Manual release PR creation

If you expect to need to edit the release notes, it's simplest to run
`librarian` *without* the `-push` flag (and using a local repo),
then create the pull request yourself:

1. Make sure your local clone is up-to-date
2. Create a new branch for the release (e.g. `git checkout -b release-bigtable-1.2.3`)
3. Run `librarian`, specifying `-library-version` if you want/need to, as above:
  ```sh
  $ legacylibrarian release stage -library=bigtable -library-version=1.2.3
  ```
4. Note the line of the `librarian` output near the end, which tells you where
  it has written a `pr-body.txt` file (split by key below, but all on one line
  in the output):
  ```text
  time=2025-09-26T15:35:23.124Z
  level=INFO
  msg="Wrote body of pull request that might have been created"
  file=/tmp/librarian-837968205/pr-body.txt
  ```
5. Perform any edits to the release notes, and commit the change using a "chore"
   conventional commit, e.g. `git commit -a -m "chore: create release"`
6. Push your change to GitHub *in the main fork* (rather than any personal fork you may use),
   and create a PR from the branch. Use the content of the `pr-body.txt` file as the body
   of the PR, editing it to be consistent with any changes you've made in the release notes.
7. Add the "release:pending" label to the PR.
8. Ask a colleague to review and merge the PR.

## Updating generated code

Librarian automation updates GAPIC/proto-generated code on a weekly basis on a
Wednesday, but generation can be run manually if an API change urgently needs
to be included in client libraries.

### Create a PR with updated code

In the common case where you just need to expedite generation, `librarian` can
create the generation PR for you:

```sh
$ LIBRARIAN_GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) legacylibrarian generate -push \
  -repo=https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go -library=bigtable
```

Ask a colleague to review and merge the PR.

### Test a local API change

If you need to test the potential impact of an API change which isn't yet in the
`googleapis` repository, you can use the `-api-source` flag to specify a local
clone of `googleapis`. You should *not* push this to GitHub other than for
sharing purposes.

Typical flow, assuming a directory structure of `~/github/googleapis` containing
clones of `googleapis` and `google-cloud-go` (and assuming they're up-to-date):

```sh
$ cd ~/github/googleapis/googleapis
$ git checkout -b test-api-changes
# Make changes here
$ git commit -a -m "Test API changes"
$ cd ../google-cloud-go
$ git checkout -b test-generated-api-changes
$ legacylibrarian generate -api-source=../googleapis -library=bigtable
```

## Using automated releases

Maintainers *may* configure Librarian for automated releases, but should do so
with a significant amount of care. Using automated releases is convenient, but
cedes control - and once a release has been published, it can't generally be
rolled back in anything like a "clean" way.

### Impact of automated releases

When automated releases are enabled, they will be initiated on a regular
[cadence](https://goto.google.com/g3doc-librarian-automation), in release PRs that contain other libraries needing releasing from
the same repository. These pull requests will be approved and merged by the
Cloud SDK Platform team.

The version number and release notes will be automatically determined by
Librarian from conventional commits. These will *not* be vetted by the
Cloud SDK Platform team before merging.

Using automated releases doesn't *prevent* manual releases - a maintainer team
can always use the process above to create and merge release PRs themselves,
customizing the version number and release notes as they see fit. Creating
a single manual release does not interrupt automated releases - any subsequent
"release-worthy" changes will still cause an automated release to be created.

### Enabling automated releases

If the repository containing the library is not already using automated releases
for other libraries (i.e. if it's a split repo instead of a monorepo),
first [open a ticket](https://buganizer.corp.google.com/issues/new?component=1198207&template=2190445) with the Cloud Platform SDK team to enable automated releases.

Next, edit the `.librarian/config.yaml` file in your repository. You will
see YAML describing additional configuration for the libraries in the
repository, particularly those which have release automation blocked. Find
the library for which you wish to enable release automation, and remove or
comment out the `release_blocked` key. We recommend commenting out rather
than deleting, ideally adding an explanation and potentially caveats, for
future readers.

Create a PR with the configuration change, get it reviewed and merged, and
the next time release automation runs against the repository, it will consider
the library eligible for automatic releases.

### Ownership of PRs once onboarded to automation

Once a library is onboarded to Librarian automation, the Librarian team is
responsible for approving and merging PRs generated by Librarian. Maintainers are
not expected to be involved in this process, unless PR checks fail.  In that
case a ticket will be opened up in the repository and needs to be addressed by
Maintainers.  This can potentially block generation/release until issue has been 
resolved.
