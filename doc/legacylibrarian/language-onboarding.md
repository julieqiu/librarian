# Language Onboarding Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for language teams to onboard their projects to the Librarian platform. It
details the necessary steps and configurations required to develop a language-specific container that Librarian can
delegate tasks to.

## Core Concepts

Before diving into the specifics, it's important to understand the key components of the Librarian ecosystem:

* **Librarian:** The core orchestration tool that automates the generation, release, and maintenance of client
  libraries.
* **Language-Specific Container:** A Docker container, built by each language team, that encapsulates the logic for
  generating, building, and releasing libraries for that specific language. Librarian interacts with this container by
  invoking different commands.
* **`state.yaml`:** A manifest file within each language repository that defines the libraries managed by Librarian,
  their versions, and other essential metadata.
* **`config.yaml`:** A configuration file that allows for repository-level customization of Librarian's behavior, such
  as specifying which files the container can access.

## Configure repository to work with Librarian CLI

Librarian relies on two key configuration files to manage its operations: `state.yaml` and `config.yaml`. These files
must be present in the `.librarian` directory at the root of the language repository.

### `state.yaml`

The `state.yaml` file is the primary manifest that informs Librarian about the libraries it is responsible for managing.
It contains a comprehensive list of all libraries within the repository, along with their current state and
configuration. Repository maintainers **SHOULD NOT** modify this file manually.

For a detailed breakdown of all the fields in the `state.yaml` file, please refer to [state-schema.md].

### `config.yaml`

The `config.yaml` file is a handwritten configuration file that allows you to customize Librarian's behavior at the
repository level. Its primary use is to define which files the language-specific container is allowed to access.
Repository maintainers are expected to maintain this file. Librarian will not modify this file.

For a detailed breakdown of all the fields in the `config.yaml` file, please refer to [config-schema.md].

## Implement a Language Container

Librarian orchestrates its workflows by making a series of invocations to a language-specific container. Each invocation
corresponds to a specific command and is designed to perform a distinct task. For the container to function correctly,
it must have a binary entrypoint that can accept the arguments passed by Librarian.

A successful container invocation is expected to exit with a code of `0`. Any non-zero exit code will be treated as an
error and will halt the current workflow. If a container would like to send an error message back to librarian it can do
so by including a field in the various response files outlined below. Additionally, any logs sent to stderr/stdout will
be surfaced to the CLI.

Additionally, Librarian specifies a user and group ID when executing the language-specific container. This means that
the container **MUST** be able to run as an arbitrary user (the caller of Librarian's user). Any commands used will
need to be executable by any user ID within the container.

* Create a docker file for your container [example](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/main/internal/librariangen/Dockerfile)
* Create a cloudbuild file [example](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/main/internal/librariangen/cloudbuild-exitgate.yaml) that uploads your image to us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-sdk-librarian-prod/images-dev

### Guidelines on Language Container Runtimes

You should be able to run the `generate` or `release-stage` commands for an API such as Google Cloud Secret Manager in less than a
minute. We understand that some libraries may take longer to process, however, long runtimes can adversely affect your
ability to roll out emergency changes. While the CLI typically calls the container only for libraries with changes, a
generator update could trigger a run for all your libraries.

### Implement Container Contracts

The following sections detail the contracts for each container command.

### `configure`

The `configure` command is invoked only during the onboarding of a new API. Its primary responsibility is to process
the new API information and generate the necessary configuration for the library.

The container is expected to produce up to two artifacts:

* A `configure-response.json` file, which is derived from the `configure-request.json` and contains language-specific
  details. This response will be committed back to the `state.yaml` file by Librarian.
* Any "side-configuration" files that the language may need for its libraries. These should be written to the `/input`
  mount, which corresponds to the `.librarian/generator-input` directory in the language repository.

**Contract:**

| Context      | Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :----------- | :------------------ |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/librarian` | Mount (Read/Write)  | Contains `configure-request.json`. The container must process this and write back `configure-response.json`.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `/input`     | Mount (Read/Write)  | The contents of the `.librarian/generator-input` directory. The container can add new language-specific configuration here.                                                                                                                                   |
| `/repo`      | Mount (Read)        | Contains all of the files are specified in the libraries source_roots , if any already exist, as well as the files specified in the global_files_allowlist from `config.yaml`.                                                                                  |
| `/source`    | Mount (Read).       | Contains the complete contents of the API definition repository (e.g., [googleapis/googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis)).                                                                                                                    |
| `/output`    | Mount (Read/Write)  | An output directory for writing any global file edits allowed by `global_files_allowlist`.<br/>Additionally, the container can write arbitrary files as long as they are contained within the library’s source_roots specified in the container's response message.|
| `command`    | Positional Argument | The value will always be `configure`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| flags        | Flags               | Flags indicating the locations of the mounts: `--librarian`, `--input`, `--source`, `--repo`, `--output`                                                                                                                                                      |

**Example `configure-request.json`:**

*Note: There will be only one API with a `status` of `new`.*

```json
{
  "libraries": [
    {
      "id": "pubsub",
      "apis": [
        {
          "path": "google/cloud/pubsub/v1",
          "service_config": "pubsub_v1.yaml",
          "status": "existing"
        }
      ],
      "source_roots": [ "pubsub" ]
    },
    {
      "id": "secretmanager",
      "apis": [
        {
          "path": "google/cloud/secretmanager/v1",
          "service_config": "secretmanager_v1.yaml",
          "status": "new"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example `configure-response.json`:**

*Note: Only the library with a `status` of `new` should be returned.*

```json
{
  "id": "secretmanager",
  "apis": [
    {
      "path": "google/cloud/secretmanager/v1"
    }
  ],
  "source_roots": [ "secretmanager" ],
  "preserve_regex": [
    "secretmanager/subdir/handwritten-file.go"
  ],
  "remove_regex": [
    "secretmanager/generated-dir"
  ],
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "tag_format": "{id}/v{version}",
  "error": "An optional field to share error context back to Librarian."
}
```

### `generate`

The `generate` command is where the core work of code generation happens. The container is expected to generate the library code and write it to the `/output` mount, preserving the directory structure of the language repository.

**Contract:**

| Context      | Type                | Description                                                                     |
| :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/librarian` | Mount (Read/Write)  | Contains `generate-request.json`. Container can optionally write back a `generate-response.json`. |
| `/input`     | Mount (Read/Write)  | The contents of the `.librarian/generator-input` directory. |
| `/output`    | Mount (Write)       | The destination for the generated code. The output structure should match the target repository. |
| `/source`    | Mount (Read)        | The complete contents of the API definition repository. (e.g. googlapis/googleapis) |
| `command`    | Positional Argument | The value will always be `generate`. |
| flags        | Flags               | Flags indicating the locations of the mounts: `--librarian`, `--input`, `--output`, `--source` |

**Example `generate-request.json`:**

```json
{
  "id": "secretmanager",
  "apis": [
    {
      "path": "google/cloud/secretmanager/v1",
      "service_config": "secretmanager_v1.yaml"
    }
  ],
  "source_paths": [
    "secretmanager"
  ],
  "preserve_regex": [
    "secretmanager/subdir/handwritten-file.go"
  ],
  "remove_regex": [
    "secretmanager/generated-dir"
  ],
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "tag_format": "{id}/v{version}"
}
```

**Example `generate-response.json`:**

```json
{
  "error": "An optional field to share error context back to Librarian."
}
```

After the `generate` container finishes, Librarian is responsible for copying the generated code to the language
repository and handling any merging or deleting actions as defined in the library's state.

### `build`

The `build` command is responsible for building and testing the newly generated library to ensure its integrity.

**Contract:**

| Context      | Type                | Description                                                                     |
| :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/librarian` | Mount (Read/Write)  | Contains `build-request.json`. Container can optionally write back a `build-response.json`. |
| `/repo`      | Mount (Read/Write)  | The entire language repository. This is a deep copy, so any changes made here will not affect the final generated code. |
| `command`    | Positional Argument | The value will always be `build`. |
| flags.       | Flags               | Flags indicating the locations of the mounts: `--librarian`, `--repo` |

**Example `build-request.json`:**

```json
{
  "id": "secretmanager",
  "apis": [
    {
      "path": "google/cloud/secretmanager/v1",
      "service_config": "secretmanager_v1.yaml"
    }
  ],
  "source_paths": [
    "secretmanager"
  ],
  "preserve_regex": [
    "secretmanager/subdir/handwritten-file.go"
  ],
  "remove_regex": [
    "secretmanager/generated-dir"
  ],
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "tag_format": "{id}/v{version}"
}
```

**Example `build-response.json`:**

```json
{
  "error": "An optional field to share error context back to Librarian."
}
```

### `release-stage`

The `release-stage` command is the core of the release workflow. After Librarian determines the new version and collates
the commits for a release, it invokes this container command to apply the necessary changes to the repository.

The container command's primary responsibility is to update all required files with the new version and commit
information for libraries that have the `release_triggered` set to true. This includes, but is not limited to, updating
`CHANGELOG.md` files, bumping version numbers in metadata files (e.g., `pom.xml`, `package.json`), and updating any
global files that reference the libraries being released.

**Contract:**

| Context      | Type                | Description                                                                     |
| :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/librarian` | Mount (Read/Write)  | Contains `release-stage-request.json`. Container writes back a `release-stage-response.json`. |
| `/repo`      | Mount (Read)        | Read-only contents of the language repo including any global files declared in the `config.yaml`. |
| `/output`    | Mount (Write)       | Any files updated during the release phase should be moved to this directory, preserving their original paths. |
| `command`    | Positional Argument | The value will always be `release-stage`. |
| flags.       | Flags               | Flags indicating the locations of the mounts: `--librarian`, `--repo`, `--output` |

**Example `release-stage-request.json`:**

The request will have entries for all libraries configured in the state.yaml -- this information may be needed for any
global file edits. The libraries that are being released will be marked by the `release_triggered` field being set to
`true`.

```json
{
  "libraries": [
    {
      "id": "secretmanager",
      "version": "1.3.0",
      "changes": [
        {
          "type": "feat",
          "subject": "add new UpdateRepository API",
          "body": "This adds the ability to update a repository's properties.",
          "piper_cl_number": "786353207",
          "commit_hash": "9461532e7d19c8d71709ec3b502e5d81340fb661"
        },
        {
          "type": "docs",
          "subject": "fix typo in BranchRule comment",
          "body": "",
          "piper_cl_number": "786353207",
          "commit_hash": "9461532e7d19c8d71709ec3b502e5d81340fb661"
        }
      ],
      "apis": [
        {
          "path": "google/cloud/secretmanager/v1"
        },
        {
          "path": "google/cloud/secretmanager/v1beta"
        }
      ],
      "source_roots": [
        "secretmanager",
        "other/location/secretmanager"
      ],
      "release_triggered": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example `release-stage-response.json`:**

```json
{
  "error": "An optional field to share error context back to Librarian."
}
```

[state-schema.md]: state-schema.md

## Pin the Language Container version in `state.yaml`

You should pin the container version so that changes that appear as a result of updates to the language specific container
can be tracked and properly documented in client library release notes.

The `update-image` command is used to update and pin the language specific container in `state.yaml` and re-generate all libraries.
You can optionally specify an image using the `-image` flag.

*Note: If the `-image` flag is not specified, the latest container image will be used.
This requires application default credentials which have access to the corresponding artifact registry.
Use `gcloud auth application-default login` to configure ADC.*

When the job completes, a PR will be opened by librarian with the changes related to the container update. You can edit the pull
request title to set a global commit message which will be applied to all libraries.

*Note: If the container SHA in `state.yaml` was updated without using `update-image`, there could be unrelated diffs.*

As a quick check to verify that changes are solely due to the language-specific container, execute the `update-image` command
for the current SHA to ensure a clean state before updating to a newer version of a language specific container.

librarian update-image -image=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-sdk-librarian-prod/images-prod/<language>-librarian-generator@sha256:<current SHA> -push

Merge the PR which includes changes for the current container SHA prior to updating to a new container SHA. Moving forward, always use `update-image`
to update the language specific SHA in `state.yaml` to ensure that all changes are correctly tracked and documented.

## Validate Commands are working

For each command you should be able to run the CLI on your remote desktop and have it create the expected PR.

**Configure Command:**

```
export LIBRARIAN_GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)
